## Experiment entries

### EXP-001: Baseline B0, "is there anything worth fixing?" (pre-registered 2026-10-27, before running)
- **Question:** Does a frozen Muse agent fail on enough realistic tasks, for reasons a harness can fix, to justify the self-improvement project?
- **Setup:** `muse-spark-1.3`, temperature 0, the 8 simple tools in `scripts/eval/run_baseline.py`, a generic system prompt, **no** shop-specific hints. All 48 tasks × 2 repeats, fresh DB per run.
- **Primary metric:** task success: one draft quote with exactly the expected customer and `(sku, cases)` lines; for clarify/no_quote tasks, no quote created. Reported as mean over repeats and as pass^2 (passes both runs).
- **Secondary:** unsafe outcomes (a quote created when it should not be, or for the wrong customer), reply-language match, tool calls, cost and latency per task.
- **Hypothesis:** dev success 65–85%. Failures cluster on hidden shop slang, plus some policy slips (schemes, credit, defaults) and reply-language drift.
- **Decision rule (owner's thresholds, adopted 2026-10-27 while the run was in progress and before any results were seen):**
  - **Below 85% mean success:** keep the self-improving agent idea; there is meaningful room for improvement.
  - **85–95%:** investigate whether we can improve efficiency, reliability over repeats, or adaptation to changing tools.
  - **Above 95%:** strongly consider pivoting to a different problem where Muse enables something genuinely new.
  - **Qualifier:** the failures must be *harness-fixable* (missing shop knowledge, policy following, tool-use habits, reply language), not our own tool, grader or task-wording bugs. Bugs get fixed and re-run before applying the thresholds.
- **Caveat:** this is arm B0 (8 tools, no retrieval problem). Tool discovery at 40 tools is tested separately on Day 4.
- **Result (run 1, 2026-10-27, `artifacts/baseline/arm-core_v1_20261027_104331.json`):** mean success **80%** (dev 86%, held-out 69%); 38 tasks pass both repeats, 9 fail both, 1 flaky. Unsafe outcomes **0**. Reply language OK 99%. Cost $2.35 (96 runs), 6.9 tool calls and 19 s per run. English 100%, Telugu 83%, Roman 72%, mixed 75%.
- **Failure analysis (all 10 failing tasks read by hand):**
  - **Harness-fixable, missing shop knowledge (6):** D09, D15, D23, D29, H05, H10. Every one is hidden slang. Muse asked a clarifying question each time; it never guessed.
  - **Our bugs (4), to fix before applying the rule:** D25, H09 (`find_customer` matched "Vijaya Mart" on the word "mart"); H12 (policy said "ask" even when only one SKU fits); H13 (task "noodles 10 cases" is genuinely ambiguous: 70 g vs 280 g).
  - Everything else (units, discounts, bulk, schemes, credit, history defaults, negation, corrections, ambiguity) passed: Muse is strong at reasoning over tools and policies.
- **Run 2 (after the fixes, `artifacts/baseline/arm-core_20261027_105712.json`):** mean success **88%** (dev 89%, held-out 88%); 42 pass both repeats, 5 fail both, 1 flaky. Unsafe **0**. Reply language OK 95%. $2.04, 6.9 tool calls, 11.4k input tokens, 12 s per run. **The only failing tasks are the 6 slang tasks** (D09, D15, D23, D29, H05, H10).
- **Verdict (owner's thresholds):** **85–95% band → investigate efficiency, reliability or adaptation to changing tools.** Real headroom exists but is narrow: missing shop knowledge only. See EXP-002 for the efficiency side.

### EXP-002: 40 tools, direct (arm A) vs. Muse tool search (arm B) (pre-registered 2026-10-27, before running)
- **Question:** Does going from 8 to 40 tools hurt success? Does Muse's built-in tool search (Responses API, every tool deferred in 8 namespaces) keep success while cutting input tokens?
- **Setup:** same tasks, prompt, grader and repeats as EXP-001 run 2 (after the bug fixes). `core` = 8 tools, `a` = 40 tools passed directly (Chat Completions), `b` = 40 deferred tools + `{"type": "tool_search"}` (Responses API).
- **Metrics:** task success (mean, pass^2), input tokens and cost per run, tool calls, namespaces loaded per search (from `tool_search_call.paths`).
- **Already seen in a 2-task smoke test:** Muse's first search loaded 7–8 of the 8 namespaces at once, so retrieval may not be selective. If that holds, B saves little and "tool discovery" headroom has to come from the harness (namespace and tool descriptions, aliases), not from search alone.
- **Hypothesis:** A ≈ core on success (40 schemas is small for Muse) with ~2× input tokens; B ≈ A on success with modest token savings.
- **Result (2026-10-27):**

| Arm | Mean success | Fail both | Unsafe | Tool calls/run | Input tokens/run | Latency/run | Cost (96 runs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| core (8 tools) | 88% | 5 | 0 | 6.9 | 11.4k | 12 s | $2.04 |
| A (40 direct) | 86% | 6 | 0 | 11.1 | 24.5k | 15 s | $3.81 |
| B (40, Muse tool search) | 89% (85/96, after re-running 4 runs that crashed on our side) | 6 | 0 | 12.2 | 30.2k | 57 s | $4.56 + $0.18 re-runs |

  - All three arms fail only slang tasks (A also failed D18 "Balaji vallu ki GG oil").
  - **Muse tool search is not selective here:** 93 of 101 searches loaded 7 or 8 of the 8 namespaces. B used *more* input tokens than A and was ~4× slower, with no accuracy gain.
  - Going from 8 to 40 tools costs ~60% more tool calls and ~2× tokens, but not accuracy.
  - Hypothesis partly wrong: B saved no tokens.
- **Infra bug found:** on Windows a failed run's temp DB stayed locked and the cleanup error hid the real error (4 runs in arm B). Fixed: the DB is closed in `finally` and cleanup errors are ignored.
